# AGENTS.md — Event Intelligence Terminal

## Vision

Bloomberg Terminal for Kalshi. Maintain a portfolio of prediction markets and a feed of real-world news. AI agent personas simulate how diverse market participants react to news, producing per-market BUY / SELL / HOLD signals before the market fully prices the information.

## Data Model

Three entity types persisted in `data/state.json`:

```
Market
  id                  str         slug, max 64 chars
  name                str         human-readable market name
  description         str         full contract description
  category            str         macro | markets | crypto | culture | policy | company
  market_probability  float       0–1, the current market-implied probability

News Event
  id                  str         slug, max 64 chars
  headline            str         the real-world headline text
  category            str         same category set as markets
  timestamp           str         ISO date (YYYY-MM-DD)

Dependency Edge
  source_id           str         news ID or market ID
  source_type         str         "news" | "market"
  target_id           str         always a market ID
  direction           int         +1 (increases target probability) or −1 (decreases)
  strength            float       0.0–1.0, how strong the influence is
  reason              str         human-readable explanation
```

## Key Concepts

### Persona Templates (`simulation.py`)
Ten archetypes: Optimist, Pessimist, Macro Trader, Economist, Retail Investor, Momentum Chaser, Contrarian, Policy Wonk, Crypto Degenerate, Entertainment Fan. Each has:
- **base_bias** — intrinsic bullish/bearish lean (e.g. Optimist +0.12, Pessimist −0.12)
- **volatility** — scales the noise term (0.08–0.16)
- **topic_tilts** — dict mapping topic → sentiment modifier (e.g. Crypto Degenerate gets +0.18 on "crypto")

Agents are selected round-robin from templates, shuffled per seed, up to the configured `agent_count` (5–20).

### Event Scoring (`score_event_text`)
Two-tier keyword lookup on headline text:
1. **Phrase match** — `POSITIVE_PHRASES` (10 phrases, e.g. "rate cut" → +0.18) and `NEGATIVE_PHRASES` (10 phrases, e.g. "misses earnings" → −0.25)
2. **Token match** — `TOKEN_WEIGHTS` (30 tokens, e.g. "bullish" → +0.14, "recession" → −0.20)

Falls back to +0.02 "neutral headline baseline" when nothing matches. Output clamped to [−0.35, 0.35].

### Topic Inference (`infer_topics`)
Six topic buckets (`TOPIC_KEYWORDS`): macro, markets, crypto, culture, policy, company. Determined by token overlap with curated keyword sets. Falls back to `["markets"]` when nothing matches.

### Composite Scoring (`_composite_event_score`)
For a given market, aggregates all linked news headlines weighted by their edge:
```
composite_score = Σ (score_event_text(headline) × edge.direction × edge.strength)
```
Clamped to [−0.35, 0.35]. Topics are the union of all linked headlines' inferred topics.

### Agent Sentiment Calculation
```
topic_effect = Σ template.topic_tilts[topic] for each detected topic
noise = uniform(-randomness, randomness) × (0.6 + template.volatility)
sentiment = clamp(event_score + base_bias + topic_effect + noise, -1, 1)
```

### Probability & Signal
```
aggregate_sentiment = clamp(mean(agent sentiments), -0.49, 0.49)
model_probability = clamp(0.5 + aggregate_sentiment, 0, 1)
edge = model_probability − market_probability
signal = BUY if edge ≥ threshold else SELL if edge ≤ −threshold else HOLD
```

### Dependency Graph Visualization
Interactive directed graph rendered by `streamlit-agraph` on the Dependencies page. Category colors:
- macro = blue (#3b82f6), markets = indigo (#6366f1), crypto = amber (#f59e0b)
- culture = pink (#ec4899), policy = emerald (#10b981), company = violet (#8b5cf6)

Market nodes are circles (size 25), news nodes are squares (size 18). Edge color: green (#22c55e) for positive, red (#ef4444) for negative. Edge width = `1 + strength × 3`.

### Persistence
All state lives in `data/state.json`, loaded into `st.session_state["app_state"]` on first access via `get_state()`. Mutations go through CRUD helpers in `utils.py` and are flushed to disk via `persist()`. Removing a market or news event cascades to delete all associated edges.

## Running

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
streamlit run app.py
```

### Pages
- **Dashboard** (`app.py`) — configure agent count / randomness / seed / threshold in sidebar, run simulations, view signal table, drill into individual markets
- **Markets** (`pages/1_Markets.py`) — add/remove prediction markets with name, description, category, probability
- **News** (`pages/2_News.py`) — fetch live headlines from NewsAPI, add/remove news events with headline, category, date
- **Dependencies** (`pages/3_Dependencies.py`) — interactive graph visualization, add/remove edges between news↔markets and markets↔markets

### Seed Data
Ships with 14 prediction markets across 6 categories (macro, markets, crypto, company, policy, culture), 5 sample news events, and 37 dependency edges (30 market→market, 7 news→market). Reset by restoring `data/state.json` from version control.

## Planned Extensions

- **LLM-powered agent reactions** — replace keyword scoring with LLM calls so agents produce richer, context-aware sentiment (use `model.py`)
- **Live market feed** — pull real-time Kalshi prices instead of mocked market probability
- **Agent memory & network effects** — let agents remember past events and influence each other across rounds
- **Event chains** — model cascading events via the dependency graph (e.g. rate cut → equity rally → crypto surge)
- **News ingestion** — auto-fetch headlines from RSS / APIs and run the simulation continuously
- **GPU-accelerated model** — when training ML models for probability estimation, use GPU
- **Market→market simulation propagation** — use market→market edges to propagate probability shifts across the graph

## Conventions

- Python 3.12+, type hints everywhere, `from __future__ import annotations`
- Frozen dataclasses for immutable config (`PersonaTemplate`), mutable dataclasses for runtime state (`AgentReaction`)
- All randomness flows through a seeded `random.Random` instance for reproducibility
- Probabilities are floats in [0, 1]; the UI converts to/from percentages at the boundary
- Data persisted as JSON in `data/state.json`, loaded into `st.session_state` at startup
- IDs are slugified from names (lowercase, alphanumeric + hyphens, max 64 chars)
- Removing an entity cascades to remove all edges referencing it
- NewsAPI calls require `NEWSAPI_KEY` in `.env`; simulation remains deterministic given a seed
